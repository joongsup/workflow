## R Markdown centered data analysis workflow
This is a repo that describes R Markdown centered data analysis project workflow, mainly using Vim, but with any text editors. While the main intent was to summarize the workflow that uses R Markdown as what I call, a "home" document, it also shows 

- how to use `reticulate` package to use Python in R Markdown, and
- how to use R objects in Python chunks and vice versa (e.g., Python objects in R chunks)

3 commonly faced scenarios are used to illustrate how to:

- work directly with R/Python code snippets in home (Rmd) document
- source/import functions defined in separate R/Python files into the home (Rmd) document, and use them there
- run and display outputs from separate R/Python files  from the home (Rmd) document

## Outputs
For a final document, see 
- [html document](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/joongsup/workflow/blob/master/workflow.html)
- [pdf document](workflow.pdf)

## Alternative
For an alternative approach to R Markdown centered workflow using Jupyter notebook, see [jupyter/](jupyter/) directory.
